This is a DRAFT example of how to create web client side monopoly, with relevant HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Main code is under "web", "web/js", "web/css".
The Servlet (very simple) is under "src/java/monopoly"
The JSONs that we send from the Servlet to the client as the AJAX response, are under "web"

There are two examples:
1. With animation - works better
2. Without animation

This is only an example, if you want to use it for your exercise you may most probably need to fix things, add code and change this example as necessary.
